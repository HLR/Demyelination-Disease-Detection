# Demyelination-Disease-Detection
The purpose of this github is to organize all of our Capstone files.
Currently this github is in the beginning stages, and we will be adding bits and pieces of code and data 
for our project.


Our folder Data files contains all of the training and test data that we are using for our initial learning process.
If the entire github is downloaded, ideally the code should run without much set-up.
